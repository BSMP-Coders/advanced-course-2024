# Guess Who? Game Enhancement with Azure OpenAI and GitHub Copilot

Welcome to the "Guess Who?" game enhancement lesson using Azure OpenAI and GitHub Copilot! In this lesson, you will learn how to enhance a basic "Guess Who?" game implemented in Streamlit with dynamic responses from Azure OpenAI and utilize GitHub Copilot to improve and extend the functionality of the game.

## Introduction to GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code completion tool that assists developers in writing code by generating suggestions based on context. It can be incredibly useful for enhancing existing projects, improving code quality, and exploring new ideas.

### Providing Context to Files

Before diving into using GitHub Copilot, it's essential to understand how to provide context to the files you're working with. In this lesson, we have provided two initial files:

- **guess_who.py**: Contains the initial static implementation of the "Guess Who?" game in Streamlit.
- **streamlit_aoai_basic.py**: Demonstrates basic integration of Azure OpenAI with Streamlit for dynamic responses.

## Activity Steps

### Step 1: Review the Static "Guess Who?" Game

- Open **guess_who.py** and review the static implementation of the "Guess Who?" game.
- Identify how user interactions, character characteristics, and game logic are structured.

### Step 2: Understanding Azure OpenAI Integration

- Examine **streamlit_aoai_basic.py** to understand how Azure OpenAI is integrated into Streamlit for dynamic responses to user inputs.
- Note how the system prompts are structured and how responses are handled.

### Step 3: Using GitHub Copilot

- Utilize the provided prompt in your development environment to guide GitHub Copilot in generating an enhanced version of the "Guess Who?" game.
- Encourage Copilot to improve the game by suggesting enhancements such as:
  - Formatting improvements in user interface layout.
  - Adding more characters with distinct characteristics.
  - Extending the game logic to include more interactive features.

```
Can you generate a simple Streamlit application that implements a "Guess Who?" game enhanced with Azure OpenAI? Start with the initial setup based on the static version found in #file:homework3_guesswho.py.

Ensure the application includes:
1. Initialization of Streamlit and necessary libraries.
2. Integration of Azure OpenAI for dynamic responses to user questions and guesses about characters.
3. Display of two characters with defined characteristics (e.g., hair color, presence of earrings) using images and textual descriptions.
4. Ability for users to ask yes/no questions or make guesses about the selected character.
5. Clear feedback for correct and incorrect guesses.
6. Reset button functionality to restart the game with a new randomly selected character.
7. Proper organization of the user interface using Streamlit's layout features, such as columns and sidebars.

Use the provided example of Azure OpenAI integration in Streamlit found in #file:ph3.py as a reference for how to implement AI responses in the game.

Ensure that the game maintains an interactive and engaging experience for users, encouraging them to guess the selected character based on the provided characteristics.

Focus on clarity, functionality, and user interaction to enhance the game using dynamic responses from Azure OpenAI.

## In-Call Activities

### Activity 1: Collaborative Enhancement

- Pair up with a partner or work in small groups.
- Use GitHub Copilot to collaboratively improve the code generated for the "Guess Who?" game.
- Discuss and implement suggestions from Copilot to enhance game functionality and user experience.

### Activity 2: Creative Extensions

- Individually brainstorm creative extensions to the game.
- Use GitHub Copilot to prototype and implement your ideas.
- Experiment with adding new game rules, customizing character traits, or integrating additional AI features.

## Conclusion

By the end of this lesson, you will have not only enhanced your understanding of Azure OpenAI integration and GitHub Copilot but also improved the functionality and interactivity of the "Guess Who?" game. Have fun exploring and innovating with AI and code!
