# Lesson 2: Interactive Coding with Streamlit 📘  
   
## Welcome to Lesson 2 of BSMP 2024 Streamlit! 🚀  
   
In this lesson, we'll learn how to make our Python programs interactive using Streamlit. We'll explore `if` statements, buttons, dropdowns, and loops to create engaging web apps.  
   
### What's Inside? 🧐  
   
- **Interactive Widgets**: Discover how to use Streamlit widgets like buttons and dropdowns.  
- **Control Flow**: Get to know `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements to make decisions in your code.  
- **Loops**: Learn about `for` and `while` loops to repeat actions in your app.  
   
### Activities 🏫  
   
- **Guessing Game**: Build a game where users can guess a number.  
- **Grade Calculator**: Create an app to calculate grades based on test scores.  
   
### Check Out Cool Apps 🎮  
   
- [**StreamlitLand Adventure RPG**](https://adventure.streamlit.app): An adventure game built with Streamlit.  
- [**Streamlit Dungeon Crawler**](https://dungeon.streamlit.app): A dungeon exploration game using Streamlit.  


### Run the App 🖥️  

Remember, to run your Streamlit app, just type `streamlit run app.py` in your terminal, and your app will spring to life!
