## Homework Assignment: Build Your Own Flask Web App 🌐

Hello, aspiring web developers! This week, we are diving into the world of Flask to create your own simple web application. Your mission is to build an interactive web app using Flask that includes routes, dynamic content, HTML templates, and forms. This project aims to help you apply what you've learned in class and get creative with web development!

### Your Task 🚀

Choose one of the following ideas or create your own:
- **Personal Blog**
- **To-Do List**
- **Meme Gallery**
- **Random Number Generator**

### Your Flask app should include:

1. **Home Page**: Welcome users to your web app with an introduction.
2. **At Least Two Routes**: Create at least two different routes that serve various purposes (e.g., a blog post, a list of tasks, or a gallery of memes).
3. **Dynamic Content**: Add dynamic content such as a random number or data from an API.
4. **HTML Templates**: Use HTML templates to create your web pages.
5. **Forms**: Include a form to collect user input and display the submitted information.

### Requirements 📝

- **Flask Setup**: Set up Flask and create routes.
- **HTML Templates**: Use at least two HTML templates for your pages.
- **Dynamic Content**: Implement at least one route that generates dynamic content.
- **Forms**: Add a form to collect user input and display the data.

### Example Structure

Your project might look like this:

```plaintext
my_flask_app/
├── app.py
├── templates/
│   ├── base.html
│   ├── home.html
│   ├── form.html
└── static/
    └── style.css
```

### Activities

1. **Create a New Route**: Add a new route that returns a personalized message.
2. **Modify HTML Content**: Customize the HTML content of your templates.
3. **Dynamic Route**: Create a route that returns a random number.
4. **Form Handling**: Build a form that collects user information and displays it on a new page.
